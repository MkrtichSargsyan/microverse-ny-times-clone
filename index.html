            <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
                and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
                beyond the world of known physics.</p>

            <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been created
                in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A potential
                hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy
                that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
                prodigiously violent instant.</p>

            <p>
                If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
                and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
                irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in
                the ocean.
            </p>

            <p>
                “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
            </p>

            <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
                the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

            <p>Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#">the first sliver of cosmic time</a> with
                telescopes at the South
                Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
                detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called <a href="#"> gravitational waves</a> — the
                signature of a
                universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth
                of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his
                colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.</p>
